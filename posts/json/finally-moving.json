It was preceded by literary classics such as &#39;dummy post&#39;, &#39;lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&#39; and &#39;asdjflakdsjf&#39;.\">first post</a> on a blog is coupled with exasperation, but then again, not many people are foolish enough to try to make their blog from scratch.</p>\n<p>This is the &quot;start&quot; of the journey - from now on my life <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=1 data-content=\"spoiler alert: it won&#39;t be.\">is meant to</a> be exciting and tiring and notable. Anything before is the part of the movie that is skipped or covered by a single picture in a montage sequence. I&#39;m supposed to be on my laptop in a hipster cafe in downtown Boston, fresh off the plane, and about to have an angry but misunderstood confrontation with a stranger who is actually the girl of my <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=2 data-content=\"I&#39;m almost there, except it&#39;s actually night-time, several Fridays after I first landed and I&#39;m at home licking leftover ketchup off a disposable plate.\">dreams</a>.</p>\n<p>But anyone who is a frequent flyer will know the journey doesn&#39;t start at the Arrivals terminal. No,  this would be more like the fuselage of the plane, the moment immediately after buckling your seatbelt. After catching your breath from the mad scramble across the terminal. After the taxi driver was <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=3 data-content=\"This has happened to me, but fortunately not on this trip. It was actually a relatively smooth ride here (at least the second time was)\">pulled over</a> for weaving in and out of the car pool lane on the way to the airport.</p>\n<p>But we&#39;re finally here. A checkpoint, back on course and ready to go on cruise control and enjoy a hopefully smoother, turbulent-free ride.</p>\n<p><em>What now?</em></p>\n<p>So, where are we going? Well, this place is pretty bare. There are a <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=4 data-content=\"These are like footnotes. Except they&#39;re at the top. Headnotes?\">few nice features</a> and I am a proponent of minimalistic design, but it&#39;s still missing a lot (like a home page).</p>\n<p>The site is still under development - no doubt you have already encountered a bug - but I wanted to put something out here because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My sister was passively-aggressively <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/naoswestvillage/statuses/461690495245500416\">nagging</a> me to</li>\n<li>This is three weeks overdue</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While I improve the site my goal is to continue to blog, and actually fill it with content. What will I be writing about? I&#39;m pretty impulsive and non-committal, but rest assured there will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pictures</li>\n<li>food</li>\n<li>programming</li>\n<li>boston-stuff</li>\n<li>football (soccer)</li>\n<li>movies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will be more about how and why this blog came to be, but for now all I want to do is point you towards the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/thetmkay/joji/issues\">GitHub Issues page</a> if you know how to file a bug, and my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thetmkay@gmail.com?subject=[Website]\">e-mail</a> if you don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading<a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=5 data-content=\"&#39;Finally Moving&#39; by Pretty Lights - great song. Over-used sample though.\">.</a></p>\n",
