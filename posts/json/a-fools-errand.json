    "content": "<p>I started my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/blog/post/finally-moving\">first post</a> by expressing how foolish it was to create your own blog from scratch. I want to qualify those comments a little bit, and pay homage a few blogging inspirations.</p>\n<p>Firstly, why is it so foolish?</p>\n<p>I can cover this in three points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It&#39;s unnecessary</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wordpress.com\">so</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tumblr.com\">many</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blogger.com\">already</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ghost.org\">existing</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.medium.com\">solutions</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.com\">out</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livejournal.com\">there</a>, all offering different variations on style, control and purpose. Whatever niche your content fits in to, whichever manner you want to present that content in, someone has probably already done all the grunt work for you. And maintains it for you. Last summer I used tumblr to account my internship abroad, and had no qualms or problems with the platform. There&#39;s seldom a good reason to re-invent the wheel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It&#39;s difficult</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A proper blogging platform is more than just serving static HTML pages (or static HTML pages and one page of routing). If you don&#39;t want to have a bad time blogging in the future, there&#39;s a lot of work in the back-end (or the writer&#39;s side) to make the proper workflow. Running a whole website in itself can be difficult - server maintenance, compatibility issues, bug fixes - and it becomes more difficult when you&#39;re writing a custom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">Content Management System</a> that makes it really easy to publish and edit content on your blog, while making sure everything still looks alright on <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=0 data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;OK, not everyone. If you&#39;re using IE8, I feel bad for you son. I&#39;ve got 99 problems but supporting old IEs ain&#39;t one&lt;/p&gt;\">everyone</a> computer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It adds little value</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The quality of a blog is not the technology that powers it. It&#39;s not how it&#39;s implemented, or how efficient it is. If you want to have &quot;The Best Blog&quot;, it&#39;s the content that drives audiences to read it. The more time you spend constructing and repairing the functional aspect of your website is time lost to improving and working on the actual reason you are building the platform for. If [insert famous person here] published static HTML pages with no style, people would still read it because they care about what that person has to say.</p>\n<p><em>Are you a masochist?</em></p>\n<p>Even though I <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=1 data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;I may have under-estimated the depth of how difficult it would be&lt;/p&gt;\">knew all the reasons</a> to not build a blog from scratch, why did I do it? It may be slightly perverse, but it&#39;s actually quite simple:</p>\n<p><em>My goal was not to make a blog</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I did need a blog. But that was a very miniscule part of the reasoning behind building one. The whole point was to actually build <em>something</em>. I wanted a personal side project, that offered value (again, I did need a blog to satisfy my family and friends), that improved my web development skills. I wanted to practice and learn more about the <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=2 data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;Things like Angular, Mongo, Node, Express, Grunt, Git etc&lt;/p&gt;\">frameworks and tools</a> I had been using and play around with some new ones [Markdown, Marked, Dokku/Docker, Bower]. Whereas school and work projects are also great experience, with a personal project you have more freedom: take your time and do things &quot;right&quot; and deliberately and <a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=3 data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;Maybe now it&#39;s becoming obvious why I was late in &#39;delivering&#39; this!&lt;/p&gt;\">flesh it out</a>.</p>\n<p>To finish this post, I wanted to pay credit to two blogging &#39;styles&#39; that really inspired the look and feel of the site. I am not new to this bandwagon, as a lot of other web sites have also mimicked them, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://svbtle.com\">Svbtle</a> are two of the most elegant and beautiful blogging designs I have come across. I encourage you to visit those links and poke around if you are not familiar with either of them<a class=\"sloppy-note\" data-index=4 data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;Also known as a &#39;snipe hunt&#39;. Thank you wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;\">.</a></p>\n",
